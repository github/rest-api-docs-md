# Get a team by name

`GET /orgs/{org}/teams/{team_slug}`

Gets a team using the team's `slug`. To create the `slug`, GitHub replaces special characters in the `name` string, changes all words to lowercase, and replaces spaces with a `-` separator. For example, `"My TEam NÃ¤me"` would become `my-team-name`.

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `GET /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}`.
