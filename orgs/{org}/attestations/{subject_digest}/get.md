`GET /orgs/{org}/attestations/{subject_digest}`

[API method documentation](https://docs.github.com/rest/orgs/orgs#list-attestations)

## All Parameters for "List attestations"

### Path Parameters

- `org` (string, required): The organization name. The name is not case sensitive.
- `subject_digest` (string, required): The parameter should be set to the attestation's subject's SHA256 digest, in the form `sha256:HEX_DIGEST`.
### Query Parameters

- `per_page` (integer): The number of results per page (max 100). For more information, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."
- `before` (string): A cursor, as given in the [Link header](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api#using-link-headers). If specified, the query only searches for results before this cursor. For more information, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."
- `after` (string): A cursor, as given in the [Link header](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api#using-link-headers).

## Operation Description

List a collection of artifact attestations with a given subject digest that are associated with repositories owned by an organization.

The collection of attestations returned by this endpoint is filtered according to the authenticated user's permissions; if the authenticated user cannot read a repository, the attestations associated with that repository will not be included in the response. In addition, when using a fine-grained access token the `attestations:read` permission is required.

**Please note:** in order to offer meaningful security benefits, an attestation's signature and timestamps **must** be cryptographically verified, and the identity of the attestation signer **must** be validated. Attestations can be verified using the [GitHub CLI `attestation verify` command](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_attestation_verify). For more information, see [our guide on how to use artifact attestations to establish a build's provenance](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds).
