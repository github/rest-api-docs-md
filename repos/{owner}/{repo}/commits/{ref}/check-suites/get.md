### Query Parameters

## Operation Description

Lists check suites for a commit `ref`. The `ref` can be a SHA, branch name, or a tag name.

> [!NOTE]
> The endpoints to manage checks only look for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for `head_branch`.

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint on a private repository.
