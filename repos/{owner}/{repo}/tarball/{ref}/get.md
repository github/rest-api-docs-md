# Download a repository archive (tar)

`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/tarball/{ref}`

Gets a redirect URL to download a tar archive for a repository. If you omit `:ref`, the repositoryâ€™s default branch (usually
`main`) will be used. Please make sure your HTTP framework is configured to follow redirects or you will need to use
the `Location` header to make a second `GET` request.
**Note**: For private repositories, these links are temporary and expire after five minutes.
