# List pending team invitations (Legacy)

`GET /teams/{team_id}/invitations`

**Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [`List pending team invitations`](https://docs.github.com/rest/teams/members#list-pending-team-invitations) endpoint.

The return hash contains a `role` field which refers to the Organization Invitation role and will be one of the following values: `direct_member`, `admin`, `billing_manager`, `hiring_manager`, or `reinstate`. If the invitee is not a GitHub member, the `login` field in the return hash will be `null`.
